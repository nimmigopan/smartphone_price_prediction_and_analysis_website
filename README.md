Steps:-
## [1] Web Scraping using 'Selenium'
- "web_scrapping_using_selenium.py" contain code to scrape the HTML content of a web page "smartprix.com", including potentially dynamically loaded content through a "Load More" mechanism.
It utilizes Selenium for web automation to interact with the webpage and extract the desired data.
#### What is Smartprix.com?
"Smartprix.com" an Indian online Shopping Comparison site that provides the latest gadgets including mobiles, laptops, electronics, TVs, home appliances, and audio products, and their prices across various 
online shopping websites like Amazon, Flipkart, Samsung, Croma etc. In this project, data related to smartphones are scrapped using 'selenium'.
#### What is Selenium?
"Selenium" is a Python library and framework used for web automation and web scraping. It is used to automate interactions with a web page, such as navigating to the site, clicking on elements, and scraping its content, which is often used for web scraping and data extraction tasks. Here Selenium is used to interact with a web browser and perform actions on 'https://www.smartprix.com/mobiles' to extract data from this website.
- The scraped HTML is saved to a file 'smartphone.html' for further processing or analysis.

**"Converting 'smartphone.html' to 'scraped_data.csv'.ipynb"** file contain code to convert scrapped data to store in a Pandas DataFrame and CSV file.
- BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTML content. BeautifulSoup is a Python library used for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- The code extracts various pieces of information from each container, such as the smartphone model name, price, and rating. It also handles cases where the rating is missing by using a try-except block.
- After extracting the data for multiple smartphones, the code uses the Pandas library to create a DataFrame with columns for each type of information.
- Finally, the code saves the DataFrame to a CSV file named 'scraped_data.csv'. This CSV file contains the scraped data in a structured format.
- The result is a DataFrame with information about smartphones, including their model names, prices, ratings, and detailed specifications. This data is stored in a CSV file for further analysis or use.

 ## [2] Data Cleaning
   Performed Data Cleaning at different levels.

**"working on 'scraped_data.csv' to 'cleaned_data1.csv'.ipynb"** :-Basic data Accessing of 'scraped_data.csv' by using pandas library.
- head(), shape
- Removing Unnecessary columns
- Checking information about the DataFrame using info()
- Checking Missing Values using isnull().sum()
- Check for duplicate rows using the duplicated().sum() method and remove them with the drop_duplicates() method.
- Convert 'price' column to integer values instead of strings.
- Removed rows where the 'price' is less than 3500, assuming these are feature phones.
- Cleaned Dataframe saved to 'cleaned_data1.csv' using the to_csv() method.
- The result is a cleaned dataset containing smartphone data without duplicate rows, with the 'price' column converted to integers, and only smartphones with prices greater than 3500.

**Working on 'cleaned_data1.csv'.ipynb"** :-
- removed some more feature phones by manual data accessing
- checked each columns and noted down if any validity, completeness, tidness and consistent issues are there
- performed some shifting operations to solve validity issues
- some manual fillings are done in place of missing values
- after the first level of cleaning, tidiness issue still remains
- data stored to 'cleaned_data2.csv'

**"Working on 'cleaned_data2.csv'.ipynb"** :-
- Created new column 'brand_name' from 'model' using string functions (str.split(), str.get())
- Created new binary columns ('has_dual_sim,' 'has_5G,' 'has_NFC,' 'has_IR_Blaster') to represent the features present in the 'sim' column.
- Extracted information from the 'processor' column into four new columns: 'processor_name,' 'processor_brand,' 'no_of_cores,' and 'processor_speed.'
- Addressed missing and inconsistent values in the 'no_of_cores' column.
- Converted the 'processor_speed' column to float and handled missing values.
- Splitted the 'ram_rom' column into 'ram' and 'rom' columns.
- Handled the missing values and converted the columns into appropriate data types.
- Created a 'fast_charging_available' column to indicate whether fast charging is supported.
- Extracted the battery capacity information.
- Extracted information about screen size, resolution, and refresh rate into separate columns.
- Created new columns for the number of rear and front cameras, as well as primary rear and front camera resolutions from 'camera' column.
- Created a new column 'extended_memory_available' to indicate whether extended memory support is available.
- Extracted the 'memory extended upto' information and handled missing values.
- Standardized operating system versions and addressed various data validity issues.
- Converted appropriate columns to the desired data types, such as integer or float.
- Second level cleaned DataFrame is saved to a new CSV file named 'cleaned_data3.csv'.

**Working on 'cleaned_data3.csv'.ipynb"** :-
- In this level i focused on making the dataset more concise and manageable for further analysis, which involves categorizing and simplifying certain features.
- Categorized the operating systems into two main categories: 'Android' and 'iOS. Now there is only these two categories.
- Brands with more than one occurrence are kept, while brands with only one phone are removed from the dataset.
- Simplified the 'pixels_in_width' and 'pixels_in_height' columns into a single 'resolution' category. The 'resolution' column is created by applying the 'resolution' function, which categorizes screen 
   resolutions into different categories like 'FWVGA,' 'HD,' 'Full HD,' etc.
- Droped unnecessary columns such as 'pixels_in_width,' 'pixels_in_height,' 'total_no_of_cameras,' and 'extended_memory_available' to simplify the dataset.
- The final cleaned dataset is saved to a new CSV file named 'final_cleaned_data.csv'.

## [3] EDA, Feature Engineering

   **"Performing EDA & missing value imputation.ipynb"**
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset, which involves analyzing the relationships between various columns and the target column 'price.'
- Various Univariate and Bivariate analysis are done that provides valuable insights into the relationships and distributions within the dataset.
- The final dataset is saved to a new CSV file named 'final_data_for_modelling.csv'.
